Quote Display Applications
==========================

_A quote a day? That would be nice, wouldn't it?_

That's what I thought too, and that's why I created these apps. 

You can use these apps to display personal/book quotes in your Android 
device. The quotes are to be read from text file(s) and displayed 
(one by one) in random order at periodic intervals (or on screen-tap). 

See more details in the individual readme for each app:

* [Random Quotes App](android_gradle/RandomQuotes/RandomQuotesApp):  
    Application to turn an Android device into a "picture frame" for 
    displaying quotes.

* [Random Quotes Widget](android_gradle/RandomQuotes/RandomQuotesWidget):  
    Application to display the quotes in a small widget in the Android 
    device front screen.

For more details about these apps and to check upcoming features, see 
the [user documentation](documentation/user_functional_specification.md).  

I am sharing these aplications under the assumption that they can provide 
some value to others, but with no warranties of any kind. See the 
[GPLv3 license file](license.md) for more details.
