Quote Display Applications
==========================

_A quote a day? That would be nice, wouldn't it?_

That's what I thought too, and that's why I created these apps. 

The quote apps repository has several applications used to display 
quotes (stored as paragraphs in a text file) in your Android device 
screen at periodic intervals (as simple as it gets).

e.g. you might have some "inspirational" quotes (from your life, from books 
...etc) that you want to always keep in mind and be reminded of 
(perhaps to brighten your day, who knows). Then you could simply launch 
the individual app and configure it (pass it the textFile(s)), from then 
on, the app will just display a new quote onTap or at periodic intervals.   

see more details in the documentation folder and in the individual app's 
readmes.

I am sharing these aplications under the assumption that they can provide 
some value to others, but with no warranties of any kind.
