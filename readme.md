Quote Display Applications
==========================

The quote apps repository has several applications used to display 
randomized notes stored as paragraphs in a text file in your Android 
device screen.

e.g. you might have some "inspirational" quotes (from your life, from books 
...etc) that you want to always keep in mind and be reminded of 
(perhaps to brighten your day, who knows). Then you would simply launch 
the individual app and configure it (pass it the textFile(s)), from then 
on the app will display a new quote onTap or at periodic intervals.   

see more details in the documentation folder and in the individual app's 
readmes.

I am sharing these aplications under the assumption that they can provide 
some value to others, but with no warranties of any kind.
