Quote Display Applications
==========================

_A quote a day? That would be nice, wouldn't it?_

That's what we thought too, and that's why we created these apps. 

You can use these _open source_ apps to display personal/book quotes 
in your Android device. The quotes are read from text file(s) and 
displayed (one by one) in random order at periodic intervals (or on 
screen-tap). 

## Random Quotes App
