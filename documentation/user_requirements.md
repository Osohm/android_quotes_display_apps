Quotes Display Apps User Requirements
=====================================

----
### Project Goal
----
Develop two applications: One simple application for picture frames (e.g. 
old android devices) and one widget application for cell-phones. The 
general purpose of the application is to process multiple text-files and 
break and randomize paragraphs (each paragraph is a quote), then save the 
processed data on non-volatile memory, finally on-click or at periodic 
intervals an UI element can read the next quote from the processed text 
file and update the view.
