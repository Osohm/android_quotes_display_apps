Quotes Display Apps User Requirements
=====================================

----
### Project Goal
----
Develop two applications: One simple application for picture frames (e.g. 
old android devices) and one widget application for cell-phones. The 
general purpose of the application is to process multiple text-files and 
break and randomize paragraphs (each paragraph is a quote), then save the 
processed data on non-volatile memory, finally on-click or at periodic 
intervals an UI element can read the next quote from the processed text 
file and update the view.

----
### Use Cases.
----
A person has a text file with some paragraphs(quotes) or notes he/she has 
made (life quotes, book summaries ...etc).

#### A house picture frame
He would like to put his notes in a digital picture frame for displaying 
them in the house/apt ...etc. He uses an old android phone as a picture 
frame and installs the Random Quotes Application to display a random quote 
at periodic intervals (every hour, every day ...etc).

#### A personal reminder.
She would like to keep her notes in her cell-phone and display a new quote 
on Tap or at periodic Intervals. She installs the Random Quotes Widget to 
display a random quote in her phone home screen at periodic intervals.
