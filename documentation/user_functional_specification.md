Quotes Display Apps Functional Specification V2.2
=================================================

## Project Goal
---
To display personal/book quotes in your Android device. The quotes are 
to be read from text file(s) and displayed (one by one) in random order 
at periodic intervals (or on screen-tap). 

We have two applications: 

* **Random Quotes App:** Application to turn an Android device into a 
"picture frame" for displaying quotes.

* **Random Quotes Widget:** Application to display the quotes in a small widget 
in the Android device front screen. 

## Use Cases.
---

A person has a text file with some paragraphs(quotes) or notes he/she has 
made (life quotes, book summaries ...etc).

### A house picture frame

He would like to put his quotes in a digital picture frame for displaying 
them in the house/apt ...etc. He uses an old android phone as a picture 
frame and installs the Random Quotes Application to display a random quote 
every hour.

### A personal reminder.

She would like to keep her favorite quotes in her cell-phone and display 
a new quote on-tap. She installs the Random Quotes Widget and places 
the widget in her home screen.
