Quotes Display Apps Functional Specification V2.1
=================================================

## Project Goal
---

Develop two applications: One simple application for picture frames (e.g. 
old android devices) and one widget application for cell-phones. The 
general purpose of the application is to process multiple text-files and 
break and randomize paragraphs (each paragraph is a quote), then save the 
processed data on non-volatile memory, finally on-click or at periodic 
intervals an UI element can read the next quote from the processed text 
file and update the view.

## Use Cases.
---

A person has a text file with some paragraphs(quotes) or notes he/she has 
made (life quotes, book summaries ...etc).

### A house picture frame

He would like to put his notes in a digital picture frame for displaying 
them in the house/apt ...etc. He uses an old android phone as a picture 
frame and installs the Random Quotes Application to display a random quote 
at periodic intervals (every hour, every day ...etc).

### A personal reminder.

She would like to keep her notes in her cell-phone and display a new quote 
on Tap or at periodic Intervals. She installs the Random Quotes Widget to 
display a random quote in her phone home screen at periodic intervals.

    Their instructions are terribly outdated. Had to troubleshoot 
    all their commands and in the end it didn't work, spent a day 
    on this, let's not do it again.
